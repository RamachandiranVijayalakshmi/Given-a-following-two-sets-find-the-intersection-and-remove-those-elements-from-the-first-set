## Given-a-following-two-sets-find-the-intersection-and-remove-those-elements-from-the-first-set
## Sample code to check the details 
```sh
print("First Set ", firstSet)
print("Second Set ", secondSet)
```
## Example Output
First Set  {65, 42, 78, 83, 23, 57, 29}
Second Set  {67, 73, 43, 48, 83, 57, 29}

Intersection is  {57, 83, 29}
First Set after removing common element  {65, 42, 78, 23}
